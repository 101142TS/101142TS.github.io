毕业也毕业了，该休息也休息了，该旅游也旅游了，感觉自己一年没干活了。不多说了，截稿日10.7左右，加油💪


## 靶子
我的论文要以代码覆盖率的提升为卖点，新式脱壳系统中：

### DroidUnpack

测试样本最晚到2016年

> DroidUnpack certainly suffers from limited cover coverage as it can only dump the code that executes.  

寻找这样的一种样本，这种样本存在被加密的字节码，且这个字节码在程序简单执行时并不会被执行到：百度的onCreate样本

> And since it is built on top of whole-system emulation, packers that enforce anti-emulation techniques will inevitably break the analysis.

反调试样本大概挺多的？

### PackerGrind

测试样本是2015年三月到2016年三月

> PackerGrind can unpack apps protected by all mechanisms except the Re-implement Method.

Re-implement Method 即是百度的onCreate

PackerGrind中提到的对于DexHunter的测试

> DexHunter cannot correctly recover the Dex files for samples
from Qihoo, Baidu and Ijiami. For Qihoo samples, the
Dex files dumped by DexHunter only contain stub classes
instead of real code, such as com.qihoo.util.Configuration and
com.qihoo.util.StubApplication, because Qihoo packer uses
its own functions instead of runtime methods monitored by
DexHunter to load classes. For Baidu samples, the Dex files
dumped by DexHunter cannot be disassembled because their
Dex headers have been modified by the packed apps. Hence,
they cannot be recognized by de-compilers. DexHunter also
cannot recover the original Dalvik bytecodes of onCreate(). For
Ijiami samples, DexHunter cannot unpack them successfully
due to the time-out checking mechanism utilized by Ijiami.
More precisely, the packed apps will check the existence of a
long-running task, which exceeds a time threshold, and exit if
found. Therefore, the process of DexHunter will stop because
its unpacking operations takes such a long time that the packed
app exits quickly.

PackerGrind的短板
> PackerGrind can only recover the Dex data after the methods
for releasing the real code are invoked. The majority of
existing packers execute such methods, which are usually JNI
methods, when a packed app is launched to avoid performance
degradation. We also use IntelliDroid [25] to trigger the
execution of such methods. Since packers may delay the
execution of such methods after knowing the mechanism of
PackerGrind we will leverage advanced input generator for
Android [52], [53] to enhance PackerGrind in future work.  
> PackerGrind is based on Valgrind. Similar to the antiemulator
methods, packed apps may detect the existences
of PackerGrind and then cease releasing the real code. For
example, they could check the app starting command or count
the time used to finish some operations. To address this issue,
we could change the return value of selected APIs to hide the
existence of PackerGrind or insert additional IR statements
to modify the registers and force the app to execute forward.

PackerGrind中对于恶意软件的叙述值得学习，恶意软件被加壳之后可以隐藏敏感行为，而被脱壳之后敏感行为才会被重新暴露。

## 存在的问题

强制反射调用native方法

说实验的时候怎么说？说2018~2019年的肯定不ok，因为目前基本都是用内存壳+vmp的形式

## 调查手段

google搜索加固关键字

- site: 看雪论坛

## 已知的情报

360至少从2017年开始就开始使用vmp技术保护 [这里](https://bbs.pediy.com/thread-223223.htm)

2018-03-28 看雪上的情报

> 不知道你的爱加密样本是什么版本，我说的爱加密方法抽取类是这样的：调用前解密smali代码，调用后马上又加密smali代码。 dexdump 的作者知道我搞过爱加密的壳，就是采用hook然后还原的。
据我所知，dexhunter能还原的方法抽取类是这样的：调用前解密smali代码，调用后就不再加密了。 

2016-07-28 看雪上的情报
> 我记得14年我参见阿里比赛的时候，阿里的壳就是这个样子，这都16年了，怎么还是这样，还只是修改codeff，都没有动态分配内存把方法数据分开存放。不过估计这是给个人开发者提供的免费壳吧，商业壳现在都上vmp了。

2017-09-17 顶象加固 java to c

2017-01-2 爱加密
> 看一下com.cioub类的clinit方法的实现就明白了，上面提到的那些垃圾类（jpvbhn、cioub、flsye…）都是*****为了“防DexHunter”添加的。

cioub类中存在exit

存在libexecmain.so和libexec.so

## 进度
7.13~7.14 在google上以 **加固 加壳 android site:https://www.pediy.com/** 关键字进行搜索，看了10页，没有看到任何与多层次解密有关的信息，只有爱加密企业版可能有这个特性

DroidUnpack论文原文

> **Multi-layer unpacking**. Many Android unpackers, depend on an assumption that there exists a clear boundary
between packer’s code and original code within packed apps
to function normally. However, according to our observation,
this assumption no longer holds. According to our study, many
commercial packers turn to multi-layer unpacking strategy,
meaning other than unpacking the original code at once and
loading into memory, they unpack the original code layer
by layer during execution. This technique will obviously
render the current memory dump based unpackers useless
since the dumped memory will contain mostly the unreadable
packed code other than the original code. Table II shows
that Bangcle, ijiami, Qihoo and Tencent adopt this
unpacking technique, among which, Tencent is the most
complex one.

包括在提到进化中也提到了，脱壳的层数越来越多，不过这个层数是从2010~2015年来说的，相对于现在2019年来说，有点水

> **Number of unpacking layers**. We have seen multi-layer
unpacking in commercial packers, but we haven’t seen such
complicated unpacking process as shown in Figure 5. In
year 2015, there exist about 1.3% of custom packed Android
malware that unpack their hidden code with more than 1000
layers. This level of complication is never observed in commercial
packers and certainly brings tremendous difficulty for
unpackers to operate. In contrast, the most complicated custom
packed malware we have in year 2010 has only 6 layers. The
ratio of packed malware that equip with 10 or more layers
unpacking has grown from 0% in 2010 to 24.73% in 2015
which is a clear indicator that Android custom packers have
been evolving in a fast pace.
